This is a Windows version of Scriptbots, originally by Andrej Karpathy, continued by Julian Hershey

Project Home: https://sites.google.com/site/scriptbotsevo/home

To compile scriptbots you will need:
* CMake >= 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
* OpenGL, GLUT (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)

For windows: 
Extracting the .zip file with the version number inside the download will give the executable and its parts. Tested on a 
Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10 machines.
If you wish to edit the source code, should be as simple as opening up the VS solution (.sln) file.
If this solution doesn't work for you, please let me know. Alternate solutions include building with CMake, but I'm not sure
that is required.
