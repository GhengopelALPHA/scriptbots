This is a Windows version of Scriptbots, originally by Andrej Karpathy, continued by Julian Hershey

Project Home: https://sites.google.com/site/scriptbotsevo/home

To compile scriptbots you will need:
* CMake >= 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
* OpenGL, GLUT (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
* GLUI >= 2.30 (http://glui.sourceforge.net/#download) (unsure if this is proper link for users, might just be for devs.)

For windows: 
Should be as simple as opening up the VS solution (.sln) file and compile the project from VS.
If this solution doesn't work for you, please let me know. Alternate solutions include building with CMake, but I'm not sure
that is required.
