12/25/13 changes
+ Added menu window via GLUI; gui integration achieved. Many options and live variables migrated there.
  Current list of all live variables:
  * Fast Mode (disable draw) and speed
  * Pausing and close/open world toggling
  * Layer drawing mode selection
  * Agent drawing mode selection
  * Following mode selection
  * Debug toggle
  All live variables are still togglable via key commands and right-click context menu (some)
  Loading, saving, and starting new worlds are available as well, along with input and alert windows
+ Terrian generator implemented. Creates land masses and oceans. Mapped and displayed via cell layers. (oceans: 0,
  land: 1. May add other value possibilities for heightmaps). Settings.h vars control number of continents and 
  percent of world which is water.
+ Lungs: inheritable, mutable bot constant, determines what environment (land, water, or both) the bot can
  survive in. New indicator next to bot visualizes this variable.
+ New brain mutation: Input Swap: two inputs for one brain box are switched. Moderate chance.
+ Now tracking number of children from each bot
+ New Follow type: Most Productive: the bot which has had the most number of children over its lifetime will be followed
  * Known bug: this is not working fully yet and only follows oldest agents. Will fix in next update

= Plant spread now directly related to fruit presence, which now requires 1/4 plant instead of 1/10
= Adjustments to agent's initial species and radius values (wider ranges for both)
= Giving birth no longer takes health for sexual reproduction, and 0.4 for assexual
= Give function of bots now activates only if target bot has less health than self
= Collisions are now softer and take the relative bot's radii into account (smaller bots get pushed more)
= Changes to brain (fewer weights will be -1 or 1 at init, dampening more likely to be seen, a lot less injury
  by activity, and increased percent of inputs set to actual sence inputs to 40%)
= Max generation following will no longer select zero generation agents, meaning if there are only zero gen
  agents, the focus will not change
= Meat decays again
= Fixes to order of operations in loading world, specifically the extra initial tick and success message
= Tweeks to mutation rates, boost, hazard layer mechanics
= Poison/hazard hurts bots more (several runs were observed with localized specitation after this change!!!)
= Food balancing
= Moved graph and infos to better fit 1366x768 res screens

7/22/13 changes
+ Hearing and Sound sensors split, now each bot has NUMEARS of these sensor pairs (called ears), 
  and each has a variable angle location on each bot. Ears drawn on bots as small tan circles
+ Health lost for having lots of actively changing boxes in the brain
+ Health lost if physics corrects for less than a TOOCLOSE (settings const) distance
+ New brain synapse type: memory; causes box to skip changing if conn value > 0.5, effectively 
  nulifying any changes to the box's value
+ Added constants for modifying simulation interface (zoom and snap speeds)
+ Added liveMutate function to brain; allows changes to brains after bot conception
+ Added variable bot radius: is inheritable, ranges between 2.5 and 17.5 for random agents (mean= 10, configurable)
+ Agents are no longer able to countdown repcounter while health is below mothering health theshold (default 0.65, configurable)
+ Count of agents with spikes now reported (no graph as yet)
+ Agents now gain repcounter bonus if at full health
+ Agents have sepparate "eyesensecellmod" and "eyesensebotsmod" vars for eyes
+ Aesthetics:
  Added Agent visual toggle; can hide agents, or color them according to stomach type, temperature discomfort, or sound volume
  Agents get white event when they are selected.
  Changes regarding spike, eye, and ear rendering related to bot radius, to allow for better looking custom radii bots.
  other color scheme changes

- Removed species count reporting (code still present)
- Version number checking for loading/saving discontinued
- Collisions no longer flag agents as spiked. Was creating too many sitting colonies.

= Temperature layer changed into fruit layer. Fruit will be a new source of food which populates randomly like old food, but is only 
  available on cells with plant present. Code for consumption by bots not yet implemented.
= Bot's clock inputs fixed; was suddenly snapping to zero at modcounter reset, so current epoch is now
  taken into account as well.
= Reduced health loss from reproduction
= Edited jump code to force bots to have a grace period between jumps. Fixed jumping jump landing bug
= Extended spike length now based on settings var
= Meat no longer decays
= Carnivores now get same bonus as herbivores for moving slowly over their food
= Omnivores now should have a harder time eating
= Agent speed factor for food consumption switched from average to max of the speeds of the two wheels
= Metabolism instead only effects rate of repcounter countdown and healthloss. REPRATE setting adjusted appropriately.
= Daughter bots should now spawn behind their mothers more.
= Plant food can only spread from 3/4 or more full cells (was 1/2)
= Agents which run at full speed will not get any food from any source.
= Code opimization
= Balancing:
  Food rates. Trying to get balance between not enough bots and explosive colonies.
  Mutation chances and magnitudes of brain boxes and agent traits tweaked


11/7/12 changes
+ Added Hazard layer: instant hazards which last a random number of ticks before disapearing, slowly increases under live bots and damages them.
+ Added Jump: output that sets a counter for "height" that slowly decreases over time. Jumping bots cannot be attacked, cannot change direction
  or angle, and cannot interact with cells (plants, meat, or hazards). Automatically locks in boost if active when jump is activated.
  Jumping bots do not interact physically with other bots, but can still attack others
+ Added saving and loading of hazard layer, and of jump "height" of bots
+ Added meat count, hazard count, and hybrid bots, omnivore bots, and max omnivore generation count to report
+ Code for blood sensor detecting meat in layer form added, but currently unused
+ Added stomach type multiplier for dead bot to meat conversion. Carnivores will give only half of what an otherwise identical herbivore
  would give. Prevents self-sufficient carnivores
+ Added Debug Mode: reports mouse events, visually displays what the selected agent can see with all eyes. Can be toggled via menu
- Eye FOV are limited to 180 degrees; anything greater doesn't make sense and starts giving bots unfair advantages
- Age counts removed from reports
- Metabolism no longer effects health loss
= Cell saving and loading changed; no longer requires more reading variables, but now takes up to 3x the number of lines from previous versions.
  Old saves are incompatable
= Adjusted init health of spawned bots to increase turnover rate and give more of a challenge to species
= Reduced "jumpiness" of "follow healthiest agent" function
= Changed weight adjusting code (again). Hopefully this time the bots will exhibit some learning behavior
= Fixed incorrect save data bug, -1 selected agent id bug, and other tune ups to ReadWrite module
= Fixed species reporting. A species is counted in reporting only when there are 3 or more members
= Fixed food overpopulation of edges bug
= Continued plant, meat, and hazard balancing
* Notable bug: bots turn instantly when jump= 0, making the action look ugly. Needs work
* FPS has been reduced to less than 200 at program init, settings as is, on an intel i3, 2.1GHz Windows machine. This is annoying


6/26/12 changes
+ Added player control of agents: use "w,a,s,d" keys to control the selected agent. Is toggleable ("w,a,s,d" keys can activate, 
  menu option can toggle to either state)
  w: increase speed; s: decrease speed; a: increase right, decrease left (turn left); d: increase left, decrease right (turn right)
+ Agent color now changes a fraction of the difference between its current color and the respective output; makes for smoother color changes
+ Added new output: Stimulus - if greater than 0.5, will allow decay and strengthening of brain box weights
+ New cell layers: plants, meat, temp are constructed, agents intereact only with plant and meat layers. More can be easily programed
+ Added meat layer. Feeds carnivores, with high yield, exponential decay
+ Added temperature layer: calculated at world init, shows where "heat" is
+ Closed world setting also disables FOODADDFREQ from adding food; only FOODMIN can add food if triggered
+ Added species agent variable, to reduce intermixing of species. All random bots have ids between -10 and 
  10, to induce beneficial crossovers.
+ Agent selection now toggleable by clicking on the selected agent to deselect it (toggling selection will also disable player control)
+ defined LAYERS: will effect the construct of cells array and the layer toggle
+ Eyes now can see meat and plant food in the world
+ Follow healthiest agent now an option, most useful when no established species exist yet.
+ Added smooth tracking of agents when follow is enabled, meaning quick screen snaps are a thing of the past
+ Saving/loading additions: save-over existing file check and saving & loading of screen location and selected agent

- Removed carnivore kill-sharing. Dead agents are now directly converted to the meat layer
- Removed food sensor input
- Removed add agents keystrokes. Adding agents now can only be triggered by right-click menu
- Removed edge-based scroll

= Loading/saving now completely modularized.
= Changed drawfood toggle to layer integer, allowing different cell layers to be displayed. Can be changed with the 'k' and 'l' keys
= Fixed temperature sensor to correctly involve agents' y-axis, rather than their x-axis, locations
= Modified proximity formulas
= Increased DIST
= Changed interface: must left-click nearer to bots to select them, left-click-drag moves the scene, and resets follow to zero if moved quickly enough
= Changes as required for new layer system to loading and saving code
= Fixed loading agents "inheriting" traits from previously loaded agents bug
= Fixed spacebar input (and direction inputs) bugs
= Fixed negative weights being set to 0 bug
= Nearly half of all boxes have weights that have a decent chance of being at -1 or 1, to better facititate equal value and
  difference connections
= Agent age report on selection changed to report its species id
= Some code opimizations

5/23/12 changes
+ More graph features: total count (black) and hybrid count (blue) plots, erases on world reset & load.
+ Fixed the crossover function. Re-introduced sexual reproduction; works off same code for asexual reproduction
+ Camera pan keystrokes now arrow keys, instead of "w,a,s,d" keys, which I plan to change into selected bot control
+ Food spread (seeding) range now settings.h variable
+ Improved and expandable cells array: replaces food layer, boasts a possible 3 additional layers (can be expanded)
  cells[LAYER][CELL_X][CELL_Y]; for [LAYER]: 0= plant food (meat, poison, water/land, light, temperature layers also possible with very little coding)
- Removed reprate agent variable. All agents must eat REPRATE amount of food in order to reproduce.
= Brain adjustments. Reactivated box gb - global weights (were disabled in some previous version)
= Metabolism now has primary control over agent's reproduction rate. Also, now effects rate of health loss (higher metabolism -> faster health loss)
= Changes to save-load function: remove reprate val, improved version checking (old versions may not behave as expected)
= Relocation of menu creating; look for glCreateMenu() function in GLView.cpp
= "Toggle closed world" menu option now represents correct open or closed state in-menu
= Rewrote player input code to something much more professional...
= Even more food balancing changes (including allowing any non-zero food cell to seed)

4/15/12 changes
+ Physics collision correction incorperated
+ Added metabolism agent variable, effects rate of food to repcounter, and meat to repcounter. Range: 0 -> 4
+ Added basic world save function
+ Added basic world load function
+ Last OUTPUTSIZE boxes are no longer forced to have connections with zero weights
+ Increased chance of change-sensitive conns (5% -> 10%)
+ Food spread now has a range of three cells (not yet adjustable via settings.h)
- Removed eye proximity inputs, merged with the colors
= Changes to mutation chances
= Changes to MLP Brain inner workings and variable ranges
= Fixed follow selected agent feature so that death of selected agent does not result in snaping to origin
= Adjusted world reset to better work with loading saved worlds.
= Further adjustment to food constants

2/15/12 changes
+ added spacebar input to bots, makes interesting yet unlikely useful behaviour changes
+ New brain output: Choice. Replaces the weight of the last connection of each box with a value in the range 0-2 based on this output. It is hoped 
  that this will lead to more complex behaviours than ever before.
+ added "follow highest generation" function, follows bot with highest gen count. NOTE: this and "follow oldest" follow the same bot in the most 
  random batches of agents.
+ food spread introduced
+ food sharing indicator changed to temperature discomfort indicator: more orange means more health being lost
= Temperature preference now more likely to match the location where a random agent is placed, to help start populations
= experimentation with a recursive weight system, where when a conn's val is above 0.6, its weight is increased. Conversely, when it's below 0.3, its
  weight is decreased, by about 0.000001 both ways
= balancing adjustments to plant food
= optimizing of code and agent loops; mostly just experimentation. 

1/13/12 changes
+ added MINFOOD constant; number of food cells with 50% MAXFOOD will never fall below this number.
+ added speed (skipdraw) report to window title
+ added new type of mutation: box copy. All attributes are copied from one box to another.
+ added David Coleman's code for hiding stats when zoomed out and custom epoch report frequency, added Anaal Nathrakh's code for closed state reporting, 
= changed/added display of total population on graph by using the cursor-line. Added a numerical display also. Shows possible change in population as well.
= Fixed follow agent and follow oldest so that the screen stays at its location when either is toggled off (no nasty jumping back to previous location)
= Fixed selecting of agents while following. Now you can select the oldest agent while following him, or select others of interest nearby!
= Fixed bugs with reporting (not clearing the file on reload, incorrect values to some fields) 

1/3/12 (GhengopelALPHA) changes
- changed process keys to allow right-click context menu. Added scroll for mouse movement near window edge. Removed right-click-move scroll ability (interference with context menu)
+ Added "delete" function: press the delete key when a bot is selected and it will be removed.
- Changed color scheme (don't like the white and gray background)
- Fixed agent selection to get correct world x&y when following
+ Added new reprate variable for bots, and is the number repcounter is reset to, with the fastest possible reprate defined by MINREPRATE. Is inherited.

1/1/2012 changes
- made many more variables per agent customizable and inheritable (such as eye sensitivity etc)
- added two more keys: 's' follows the selected agent around. 'o' follows the oldest agent around.
- number of carnivores and herbivores are now visualized on top of the world
- added a new type of brain: assembly brain, but it needs much more work. i.e. don't use

v1.3
- Fixed compilation issues on Linux
- Ported to CMake build system

v1.2 changes (released 19 January 2011):

- New Brain: DWRAON (Damped Weighted Recurrent AND/OR Network). This is better due to more continuous behavior than the old, discrete, rule based system.
- No dichotomy of herbivore/carnivore. There is a stomach specialization variable between 0,1. At 0, specialized to process plants, at 1, meat. This trait is inherited and undergoes mutation. This also supports emergence of omnivores, which can process both, to a lesser degree.
- Meat food is now only allocated when a creature dies, as opposed to when it is injured. It is distributed evenly to all nearby creatures when the kill occurs. This leads more clearly to emergence of hunting packs.
- Ability to judge health of an organism in front was added. I think of it something as a blood sensor. Essentially, it fires if something wounded is ahead. This can make agents become selective when hunting.
- More sensors were added: Two clock neurons that have time-varying activity at a some frequency that can be inherited. This is useful for introducing base activity into the brain, and also for giving agents a simple way to keep track of time, and do something at regular intervals. 
- Also, a hearing sensor was added that directly simulates sound. Agents can now shout at each other, but probably lack the capacity to temporally parse a shouting stream and create anything that resembles a non-trivial language.
- Sound generator actuator was added, which simulates creating sound and corresponds to shouting.
- Ability to share food was added. An agent can choose to give up its food to organisms around it. This potentially enables emergence of altruism: When a bot is too high in health, it may sense that there is one of its kind ahead that needs food, and choose to give it up.
